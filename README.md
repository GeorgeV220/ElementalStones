# ElementalStones
A Minecraft Spigot plugin to add elemental stones to your server

## Goal
The goal for this plugin is to enhance the players experience by adding special stones to the base game.
With these stones the player can do all sorts of moves.

There are 5 base stones with all as specific recipe. You can upgrade the stones by creating the correct recipe in the crafting table together with the previous upgrade of the stone.
